<p class="reset">~2003-2011. NREL has many different technology sub-sites that have particular interest areas. Some of these are cross-cutting. For years news and events 
were hand-coded by administrators for each technology. For example, news pertaining to Solar may also have had information relevant to Technology Transfer or 
vice versa, and on and on for all possible combinations, creating a disconnect and duplication across the mother and sister sites. We developed a solution that 
overcame this by allowing site admins to subscribe to other site news and events, and streamlined publication across all of NREL and even into EERE and the 
Source sites as well. The administrative area allowed for customization of number of news and event items on sidebars in home pages, and control over 
subscriptions and notifications. Items were published immediately on host sites, and a nightly "sweeper" pulled subscriptions into news and event pages and 
could be manually kicked off by a super-user. The screenshots show the main news and events pages, which were linked to from each sub-site sidebar. An example 
of the sidebar can be seen on the Basic Sciences project from in the NREL tab. This application has had large and far reaching impacts across the laboratory for 
many years and has grown to include solicitations and contacts as well.
