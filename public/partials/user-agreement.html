<h1>User Agreement</h1>
If you click "I agree to the terms of the user-agreement," in essence it means absolutely nothing. This is only a demonstration. 
Had this been a real user agreement you would have fallen asleep at the terminal while the cat finished your lukewarm coffee and the z, x, c, and v keys 
became indelibly stamped onto your forehead. And, upon awakening, you would have scrolled down to the bottom (because you know we check to see if you did that) 
and closed the document without reading or understanding a thing.

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
If you are astute you might have noticed this isn't a PDF file at all. I only presented it that way because these things are normally documented as PDFs. And, if I 
reuse the code the links will be semi-correct. Of course I'll have to update the file size unless I was super lucky at guessing or perhaps I will implement a file 
reader and auto-check the size. At any rate, I can't believe you are still reading this.

<h4>The Fine Print</h4>
<span class="smaller">This is where most people won't venture. Don't blame me if you never read the fine print. It's got the most important message and 
can be glossed over easily if you aren't on your toes. The essence of this is that if you don't contact me with a super-killer dream web programming job then I can't 
help you realize your dreams. So do the right thing and close this window then get your mouse to the contact link and click it! Thank you ;-)
