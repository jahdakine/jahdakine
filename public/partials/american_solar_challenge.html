<p class="reset">A contract to supply near real-time updates from lat-long data sent from <href="http://americansolarchallenge.org/">ASC's</a> servers. An administrative area gave the ability 
to publish out map updates and rankings, as well as photo updates to the site. Just before Google map technology, my involvement was with the 2005 'rayce,' as 
they call them.
