<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
If you click "I agree to the terms of the user-agreement," in essence it means absolutely nothing. This is only a demonstration. 
Had this been a real privacy policy you would have freaked out at the lack of privacy it actually offers. Its too late too worry about that 
though, your entire life is on a hard drive somewhere.

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
We know everything there is to know about you so there is no privacy. You are an open book. Some of your chapters are really pretty interesting actually. 
I really like the part where you started thinking, "why am I reading this anyway?"
