<p class="reset">2008. Part of a host of tools available for the EnergyPlus software family. This form generates a file that can be used for automated energy
simulations. Built entirely from database queries, all the form fields are derived from the schema. A driver iterates the query and builds the html fragments. 
Complex Javascript calculations allow simple or detailed simulations, and expose the correct fields given key inputs as the user navigates the form.
