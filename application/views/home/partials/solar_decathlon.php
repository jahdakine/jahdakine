<p class="reset">2003-2009. This site was driven by data sent via complex spreadsheets sent every 15 minutes from the Mall in Washington, D.C. to NREL servers. 
Data had to be parsed and loaded timestamped into SQL, then inserted into database tables and served in various cuts as displayed here. 
A creative resolution to a problem with penalty points not reflected in total scores meant calculating differences of contests (which included penalites) 
from totals and averaging subtraction across all contest chart bars. Error handling was crucial to keeping site appearance up despite power outages and other 
vagaries of multiple points of failure across server connections. Site traffic was highest across the competition portion of the site during the event. 
No archival data exists for 2009, but 2011 is representational of the design.
